# Zomato_Analysis_Project-3

## SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato â€“ A Food Delivery Company
## Overview
This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. 
The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.
## Project Structure
**1.Database Setup**: Creation of the zomato_db database and the required tables.

**2.Data Import**: Inserting sample data into the tables.

**3.Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.

**4.Business Problems**: Solving 20 specific business problems using SQL queries.
## DataBase Setup
```sql
Create database zomato_db;
```
## Table Creation
```sql

--Customer Table--
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER
(
customer_id  INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_name Varchar(50),
reg_date Date
)

--Restaurant Table--
CREATE TABLE restaurant
(
restaurant_id INT primary Key,
restaurant_name varchar(80),
city varchar(50),
opening_hours varchar(60)
);


-- Orders Table
CREATE TABLE Orders
(
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INT , -- This is coming from customer table
restaurant_id INT , -- This is coming from restaurant table
order_item varchar(80),
order_date DATE,
order_time TIME,
order_status VARCHAR(70),
total_amount FLOAT
);

--- Rider Table--
CREATE TABLE Rider
(
rider_id INT  PRIMARY KEY,
rider_name varchar(80),
sign_up  DATE
);

-- Delivery Table --
CREATE TABLE Delivery
(
delivery_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_id INT, -- coming from order table
delivery_status Varchar(80),
delivery_time Time,
rider_id INT -- coming from rider table
)
```

## Adding Constraints to Link Fact and Dimension Tables
```sql
-- ADD Foreign Key constraiints Order table for customer
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customer(customer_id);

-- ADD Foreign Key constraiints Order table for restaurant
ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_restaurant
FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id)
REFERENCES restaurant(restaurant_id);

 -- ADD Foreign Key constraiints delivery table for order
ALTER TABLE Delivery
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_Order
foreign key (order_id)
REFERENCES orders(order_id);

ALTER TABLE Delivery
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rider
foreign key (rider_id)
REFERENCES Rider(rider_id);

ALTER TABLE Delivery
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_rider;

ALTER TABLE Delivery
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_rider
FOREIGN KEY (rider_id)
REFERENCES Rider(rider_id);
```
## Inserting Data into Tables
**Method 1**: Use SQL INSERT statements to manually add records.
**Method 2**: Import data from CSV files with column names and data types aligned to the table structure.
```sql
---Method-1--
INSERT INTO rider (rider_id, rider_name, sign_up) VALUES

**Note** Rest table I have imported using Method-2

## Checking for NULL Values in Columns
```sql
- CHHeck Null value in the table
select * from customer
where customer_id is NULL
OR customer_name IS NULL
OR reg_date IS NULL

-- Check NULL VALUES IN RESTAURANT TABLE
SELECT * FROM restaurant
WHERE restaurant_id IS NULL
OR restaurant_name IS NULL
OR city IS NULL
OR opening_hours IS NULL

-- CHECK NULL IN  Delivery TABLE
SELECT * FROM Delivery
WHERE delivery_id IS NULL
OR order_id IS NULL
OR delivery_status IS NULL
OR delivery_time IS NULL
OR rider_id IS NULL
 
 -- CHECK NULL IN RIDER TABLE
 select * from rider
 WHERE rider_id IS NULL
 OR rider_name IS NULL
  
select * from orders
